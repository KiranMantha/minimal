# Minimal.css
Minimal is a classless symantic html driven css. It employs normalize.css at its core. It makes use of gray color pallet of bootstrap.

## Ideology
Remembering so many classes is very hectic. Not only that using so many classes on a html tag cluttered the experience. The idea is not new but it sparked my interest in creating one with already existing ones like normalize.css (yea this is a cocktail but it tastes good :wink: )

## Help needed
Need your idea on creating grid layout.
